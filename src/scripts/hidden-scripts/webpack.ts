  // Note that we only recommend to use `public` folder as an escape hatch
  // for files like `favicon.ico`, `manifest.json`, and libraries that are
  // for some reason broken when imported through Webpack. If you just want to
  // use an image, put it in `src` and `import` it from JavaScript instead.
