  // project directory is dangerous because we may expose sensitive files.
  // Instead, we establish a convention that only files in `public` directory
  // get served. Our build script will copy `public` into the `build` folder.
  // In `index.html`, you can get URL of `public` folder with %PUBLIC_URL%:
  // <link rel="shortcut icon" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico">
  // In JavaScript code, you can access it with `process.env.PUBLIC_URL`.
  // Note that we only recommend to use `public` folder as an escape hatch
  // for files like `favicon.ico`, `manifest.json`, and libraries that are
  // for some reason broken when imported through Webpack. If you just want to
  // use an image, put it in `src` and `import` it from JavaScript instead.
